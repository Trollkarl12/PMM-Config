        summary: The Starfleet vessel USS Enterprise sets out on a five-year mission to explore new worlds and seek out new lifeforms in the Alpha Quadrant of the Galaxy. Under the command of Human Captain James T. Kirk and the Vulcan Spock, the Enterprise comes across many strange lifeforms in the first year of its mission – including shapeshifters, androids, and even more bizarre creatures. Elsewhere, there are run-ins with several prominent species, including the warrior race of the Klingons, the Romulan Star Empire, and the Gorn.
      2:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70680
        summary: Following their introduction near the end of the previous season, the Klingons were established as major adversaries, appearing in three episodes, "Friday's Child", "The Trouble with Tribbles", and "A Private Little War". The second of those would turn out to be one of the show's most popular and influential episodes, introducing Koloth and the Tribbles, who reappeared on Deep Space 9, with other characters reappearing in the Star Trek The Animated Series episode "More Tribbles, More Troubles".
      3:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70681
        summary: With Star Trek having narrowly avoided cancellation, the basic format remained the same as Season 2. The season opened with "Spock's Brain", a story in which Kara, the priestess-leader of the underground Eymorg city, steals Spock's brain and transfers it to a receptacle so that he can rule their society.

        summary: A hundred years after the era of James T. Kirk, Captain Jean-Luc Picard takes command of the Galaxy-class USS Enterprise-D with a hand-picked crew. They take on assignments from Starfleet as well as explore those strange new worlds, going where no one has gone before.
      2:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70711
        summary: Season 2 saw the departure of Dr. Beverly Crusher to head Starfleet Medical and her subsequent replacement by Dr. Katherine Pulaski. A number of stories focus on the development of Data, introducing him to his "grandfather," revealing his interest in Sherlock Holmes, determining his status as a living being, and revealing to him the moral implications of the Prime Directive. He also clashes several times with Dr. Pulaski, who does not initially regard him as a living being.
      3:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70712
        summary: Season 3 is marked by a string of abductions, with six people being kidnapped, and Captain Picard being abducted no less than three times. Captain Picard is abducted by aliens, takes a vacation which eventually gets him caught up in the search for a weapon from the future, mind melds with the legendary Vulcan Sarek, and is mistaken for a god by a primitive culture. He was again kidnapped with Doctor Crusher by Ansata terrorists. Data was abducted by Kivas Fajo, a collector of rare objects.
      4:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70713
        summary: Season 4 of TNG saw the show embracing the notion of serialized storylines. A recurring theme throughout the season is the notion of a brewing Duras-Romulan plot against the Federation, coupled with Worf's effort to reclaim his family honor. Both storylines were introduced in TNG Season 3's "Sins of the Father". Worf's discommendation is a major theme in "Family" and "The Drumhead", while his dishonor and the Duras-Romulan plot take center stage in the episodes "Reunion", "The Mind's Eye", and "Redemption".
      5:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70714
        summary: The fifth season of Next Generation starts off with the Federation exposing the secret Romulan-Duras plot explored in the previous season. ("Redemption II") Ensign Ro Laren joins the crew of the USS Enterprise-D, and although some members of the crew, notably Commander William T. Riker, have misgivings about her presence on board, she eventually proves herself to be a valuable crew member.
      6:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70715
        summary: The season begins with the successful rescue of Data from the nineteenth century, and we learn just how long Guinan has actually known Picard. The crew also took part in a variety of shady operations, the first of what would be many departures from Gene Roddenberry's more Utopian vision of the future. Picard is temporarily assigned away from the Enterprise for a dangerous espionage mission against the Cardassians, but is captured and subjected to torture, nearly succumbing before being released. Deanna Troi engaged in a similarly risky mission of espionage against the Romulans. The Enterprise also nearly became a victim of space pirates.
      7:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70716
        summary: The crew defeats Lore and his group of rogue Borg. Geordi La Forge struggles with the loss of his mother, while Data discovers his own. The captain foils a terrorist plot by Vulcan isolationists. It is discovered that warp drive damages subspace. William T. Riker is forced to choose between his loyalties to an old captain and Picard. Deanna Troi and Beverly Crusher learn long-kept family secrets. Worf meets a future version of Alexander Rozhenko, and both he and Deanna consider a romance. Wesley Crusher leaves Starfleet to study with The Traveler. Ro Laren defects to the Maquis. Q concludes his trial of Humanity, giving Picard an opportunity to save mankind.

  "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine":
    year: 1993
    url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70892
    seasons:
      1:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70893
        summary: The Provisional Government of Bajor invites Starfleet to help them rebuild after the Cardassian Occupation. Commander Benjamin Sisko is selected to take command of their space station, formerly known as Terok Nor that is then designated by Starfleet as Deep Space 9. As part of the agreement between the Federation and Bajor, Starfleet will help them to become a member of the Federation.
      2:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70894
        summary: In their second year together, the crew of Deep Space 9 face problems that will affect the galaxy forever. A Bajoran extremist group attempts to force the Federation out of the Bajoran system. The Cardassians are secretly supplying them with weapons, hoping to return to reclaim the planet and hold the Bajoran wormhole for the Cardassian Union. However, the greatest enemy of all is lurking beyond it.
      3:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70895
        summary: Benjamin Sisko brings the USS Defiant, a ship he helped to construct at the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards, to Deep Space 9 to protect the station from a Dominion attack. He and his crew enter the Gamma Quadrant on a mission to locate the Founders of the Dominion. During the same mission, Odo locates his people's homeworld in the Omarion Nebula. His joy at discovering others of his kind is short-lived, however, as the Changelings are discovered to be the Founders of the Dominion. Odo returns to DS9 with his crew mates.
      4:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70896
        summary: Life in the Alpha Quadrant has been uneasy since the revelation the Founders have infiltrated the Alpha Quadrant. Convinced the Dominion are behind a successful coup on Cardassia, Gowron orders a Klingon invasion of the Cardassian Union. When the Federation condemns the invasion, and Sisko protects the members of the Detapa Council, Gowron withdraws from the Khitomer Accords and attacks the station. Although the attack is unsuccessful, the Klingons refuse to give up the Cardassian colonies already seized. Consequently, Captain Benjamin Sisko asks Worf to join the crew of Deep Space 9.
      5:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70897
        summary: Sisko, Odo, O'Brien, and Worf are sent on a mission to expose Chancellor Gowron as a Changeling infiltrator, only to discover that it was Martok who had been replaced. The Changeling impersonating Martok is killed, but Gowron is still not ready to end the war with the Federation but does agree to call a cease fire and begin talks. The crew is able to capture a crashed Jem'Hadar ship and return it to Starfleet. Worf helps Quark woo his ex-wife Grilka, while he and Jadzia Dax start a relationship initiated by Dax.
      6:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70898
        summary: The season begins three months into the Dominion War, and things do not go well for the former crew of Deep Space 9. The crew enters Cardassian space to destroy a ketracel-white installation, Sisko leads a battle to reclaim DS9, O'Brien infiltrates the Orion Syndicate, the Romulans enter the Dominion War, and Jadzia Dax is killed by a pah-wraith-possessed Dukat. Many episodes in this season focus on moral issues in wartime, especially the hard choice between different calamities such as betrayal of principles, treason, and the deaths of dear or unknown people.
      7:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70899
        summary: Benjamin Sisko discovers his mother was a Prophet, a new Dax host arrives on Deep Space 9, Odo discovers that his people have been infected with a fatal disease and Julian Bashir undertakes an assignment for Section 31.

In the concluding episodes of the season (and the series), the Cardassian-Dominion alliance breaks down, Colonel Kira leads a Cardassian resistance movement involving Legate Damar and Elim Garak, and the alliance of Federation, Klingon, and Romulan forces claim victory in the Dominion War.

  "Star Trek: Voyager":
    year: 1995
    url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70749
    seasons:
      1:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70750
        summary: Captain Kathryn Janeway's chief of security, Lieutenant Tuvok, has disappeared while involved in a counter-espionage mission aboard a Maquis ship, whose last known position was somewhere in the Badlands. While en route to investigate Tuvok's disappearance, the maiden voyage of the Federation starship USS Voyager ends in disaster as the ship and her crew are pulled seventy thousand light years into the far reaches of the Delta Quadrant.
      2:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70751
        summary: Recurrent themes of tension and mistrust between the Starfleet and Maquis crews, although largely resolved in the season one episode "Learning Curve", once again resurface in "Maneuvers" and "Meld". Inter-crew relations are brought to a head while under intense, continuous attack by the Kazon in "Alliances", and when Janeway is cajoled into initiating a Maquis-led idea of a deal between the USS Voyager and the warring Kazon factions, narrowly averted disaster is enough to quell the two crews into a marriage of Starfleet ideals and ethics.
      3:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70752
        summary: Season three begins with the departure of the Kazon. The Doctor gains freedom from sickbay in "Future's End", by way of an autonomous mobile emitter. The same episode also has Harry Kim taking command of Voyager for the first time when the four ranking bridge officers beam to 1996 Earth.
      4:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70753
        summary: Season four furthered and even embellished upon the changes to the franchise already seen by the middle to end of season three. "Scorpion, Part II" concluded the season three finale and—most crucially to the future of the series—introduced a new character, Seven of Nine. One episode later, Jennifer Lien left the cast and Kes departed Voyager, not to return until the season six episode "Fury".
      5:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70754
        summary: With Brannon Braga taking up the showrunner's role after Jeri Taylor's retirement, season five saw the franchise settle into what was to become a familiar pattern of story-telling following the changes made during the latter half of season three, and the tumultuous events of season four. A desire to return to Earth remained the Voyager crew's singular mission, but the themes of "family" and of Voyager as "home" introduced in seasons three and four meant that the series paradigm gently shifted in season five.
      6:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70755
        summary: Star Trek Voyager's sixth season was the first to be televised without running concurrently with seasons of Star Trek Deep Space Nine, and can be characterized as having the feel of being oddly disconnected from seasons four and five that preceded it. As a result, Voyager's season six could be said to have more in common with the story-telling of season one, being populated by numerous episodes with story lines wholly independent of each other and the greater series arc, which by this point, was very well established.
      7:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70756
        summary: A multitude of familiar aliens are revisited for a final shout including the Ferengi in "Inside Man", the Hirogen in "Flesh and Blood", the Klingons in "Prophecy", the Hierarchy in "The Void" and "Renaissance Man", the Q in "Q2", and the Talaxians in "Homestead".

  "Star Trek: Enterprise":

    seasons:
      1:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70902
        summary: In 2151, Humanity finally prepares to take its first steps into deep space by way of the prototype warp five starship Enterprise NX-01, led by Captain Jonathan Archer. Following an incident in which a lone Klingon courier crashes in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, Archer launches the ship from Earth spacedock in order to bring the Klingon home. He then takes Enterprise on a mission of exploration.
      2:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70903
        summary: The second season of Star Trek Enterprise sees less focus on the Temporal Cold War and the conflicts between Vulcan and Andoria. Instead, the season embraces a more episodic format than that of the previous year. However, some service is given to the aforementioned story arcs and a new one is introduced involving the Klingon Empire's attempts to capture and incarcerate Captain Archer. The biggest change to impact Enterprise occurs in the season finale, when an attack against Earth by the Xindi wipes out seven million people. Enterprise NX-01 is refitted and sent on a new mission to locate the Xindi and do everything possible to prevent a second attack.
      3:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70904
        summary: The third season of Star Trek Enterprise focuses on Enterprise NX-01's mission to prevent a second Xindi attack from destroying Earth. Unlike the show's second season, Enterprise's third season embraces a heavily serialized format dedicated to the search for the Xindi primary weapon. Additionally, Archer, Trip, and T'Pol receive considerable character development throughout the year.
      4:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/70905
        summary: The fourth season of Star Trek Enterprise concludes the Temporal Cold War story arc that had been a staple of the series since "Broken Bow". The remaining episodes of season four refocus Enterprise on the series' original prequel concept by exploring cultural shifts on Vulcan; establishing the beginnings of conflict between Earth and the Romulans; explaining the difference in appearance between the Klingons of The Original Series and those of Star Trek The Next Generation; giving an insight into the mirror universe prior to any crossover with the prime universe; and exploring the obstacles Humanity must overcome before allying with alien species.

        summary: Chrisjen Avasarala, a United Nations executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. Ceres police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter Canterbury and the Martian Navy flagship Donnager are destroyed by unknown stealth ships. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton survive both attacks and escape in a Martian gunship named the Tachi. They subsequently rename the ship Rocinante which becomes the main setting of the series. The crew of the Rocinante, with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid Eros, including Julie.

        summary: The crew of the Rocinante, along with members of the OPA, attack the station responsible for the biohazard on Eros. Learning that it is an extra-solar bio-weapon known as the protomolecule, they attempt to destroy Eros. Miller becomes trapped on Eros, and dies when it crashes into Venus. Martian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later, during peace talks between Earth and Mars, becomes a protégé of Avasarala. The crew tries to help a father, Prax, find his daughter. In the process, they encounter and kill a figure akin to the one that Draper fought, now known as a "protomolecule hybrid", developed by Jules-Pierre Mao. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of Eros into the planet, is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.

        summary: The UN declares war, as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what is happening on Venus. Political tensions soar as the OPA is recognized as the government of the Belters, and Prax gets reunited with his daughter. The protomolecule forms the Ring, a structure which takes an orbital position beyond Uranus, and the race begins between all three governments to send their ships through. After a Belter racing ship slingshots through the Ring at high speed, the ring believes the high speed humans and objects to be dangerous and activates defenses that threaten humanity. Through Holden, a projection of Miller tries to shut off the defenses of the ring, and convince the protomolecule that humanity is not a threat.
      4:
        url_poster: https://theposterdb.com/api/assets/108612
        summary: A large rush to other solar systems with habitable worlds begins, with thousands of planets accessible now via the Ring. Refugee ships from the Belt and overcrowded Earth are stopped at the gateway. A ship runs the blockade, and the crew of the Rocinante are sent through the portal to investigate the situation on the exoplanet that has been settled by these Belter refugees, called Ilus. The settlers have been joined by an officially backed scientific expedition with private military support, often leading to violence between the two groups. The crew tries to ease the tensions, but fails, and decide to find out what is happening on the planet and where the previous civilization has gone. With the help of Miller, Holden reactivates the ancient structure, setting off a chain of cataclysmic events. Efforts to terraform Mars also begin to wane as ready-made habitable worlds are now available, as Bobbie Draper realizes.

In the future, a person's memories and consciousness (termed digital human freight, or DHF) are recorded onto a disk-shaped device called a cortical stack, which is implanted in the vertebrae at the back of the neck. These storage devices are of alien design and have been reverse-engineered and mass-produced but can only be made from the material on Harlan's World. Physical human or synthetic bodies are called "sleeves" and stacks can be transferred to new bodies after death, but a person can still be killed if their stack is destroyed and there is no backup. Only the wealthiest, known as "Meths" in reference to Methuselah, have the means to change bodies through clones and remote storage of their consciousness in satellites, so they never have to die of old age before being resleeved.
